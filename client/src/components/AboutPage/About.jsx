                        <b>About Me: </b>
                        I discovered my love for pyrography three years ago, and ever since, I've been captivated by the dance of fire on wood. Each burn tells a story, and through my art, I aim to weave tales that resonate with the soul. Dobrich, with its rich cultural heritage, serves as my muse and a wellspring of inspiration for my creations.</span>

                        <b>The Art of Pyrography: </b>
                        Pyrography, also known as wood burning, is an ancient art form that involves using a heated tool to create intricate designs on various wooden surfaces. What makes pyrography truly magical is the marriage of precision and creativity, as every stroke etches a moment in time onto the canvas of wood.
